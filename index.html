                <p>
                    Determining the best overall care for a senior loved one can be an overwhelming decision. You have to assess the pros and cons of different care options and weigh in relevant concerns such as personal preferences, financial considerations, health issues and more. You may even experience feelings of guilt and doubt that can make decision-making even more challenging.

                <p>
                    As you dwell on what to do next and where to turn, the question of whether in-home care is better than nursing home care or an assisted living facility could arise. To help you through this thought process, here is a list of seven benefits of in-home care:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Comfortable, familiar surroundings</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        Perhaps the most apparent benefit of in-home care is that it allows older adults to remain in their homes, limiting disruptions associated with relocation and enabling them to maintain their routines. Sudden changes in surroundings or habits can be particularly distressing for older adults who are living with <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/dementia-care"><u>dementia or Alzheimer’s disease</u></a>.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Customized care options</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        Whether your senior needs part-time care during specific hours of the day or <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/tustin/articles/live-in-or-24-hour-care-allowing-elderly-adults-to-age-in-place-in-their-homes/432">24/7 assistance</a>, in-home care offers a variety of flexible scheduling options and a complete “menu of services” that can be customized to certain needs. Your loved one will be matched with a compatible caregiver who can assist with specific tasks during the hours when care is needed.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Affordability</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        In-home care is often less expensive than a nursing home or assisted living facility. Although many high-quality senior facilities offer comprehensive services, this “one-size-fits-all” model may result in your loved one paying for amenities that aren’t needed. Due to the array of care options offered by in-home personal care providers, many families can save by paying only for required services on the days and times that they need them most — without compromising on the quality and availability of care.
                    </p>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        Additionally, remaining at home eliminates moving or storage costs that may come along with a move to an older adult facility.
                    </p>

                    </section>
                    <li><b>Personalized care</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        In-home caregivers offer one-to-one care, which helps them develop a more personal relationship with care recipients. This level of personalized attention enables caregivers to learn about your senior loved one’s likes, dislikes, and interests. This approach also helps caregivers anticipate needs, communicate effectively, provide companionship, and identify problems that should be brought to your attention.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Safety/health benefits</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-us-nursing-home-outbreak/607450/"><u>nursing homes have been among the hardest hit during the coronavirus</u></a> (COVID-19) pandemic. Opting for home-based personal care could reduce the chances your loved one catches a serious illness by limiting their exposure to other nursing home residents, caregivers, and staff members.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Additional privacy</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        Nursing home residents share outdoor spaces, visiting rooms, dining facilities, recreation spaces — and sometimes even a bedroom and bathroom — with other residents. In-home personal care allows your loved one to maintain their privacy and have access to familiar spaces on their terms and timeframes. Although a caregiver will be invited into their home, our personal care professionals are trained to respect your loved one’s privacy by providing care and companionship when needed and taking a step back when requested.
                    </p>
                    <li><b>Encouraging independence</b></li>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;">
                        If older adults require limited assistance with specific tasks, a move to a nursing home could force them to give up their cherished independence sooner than necessary. For example, your loved one may need help with grocery shopping, although they still enjoy planning and preparing meals without assistance. At a nursing home, your loved one may not have the option to continue planning and preparing meals. An in-home caregiver allows your loved one to continue performing meal planning and preparation tasks independently while helping them receive assistance in other areas.
                    </p>
                </ol>
                <p style="padding-top: 10px;">
                    As a family caregiver, your loved one’s well-being is a top priority. At Visiting Angels, our professional caregivers provide outstanding personal care services for older adults – and peace of mind for family members – that are difficult to match at older adult facilities. If you think home care might be an option for your loved one, our Visiting Angels care coordinators would be happy to discuss your loved one’s needs during a <a href="https://www.visitingangels.com/how-do-i-get-started"><u>free in-home care consultation</u></a>.
